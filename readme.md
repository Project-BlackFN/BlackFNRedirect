# BlackFNRedirect

#

**What is this?**

**So when I first developed BlackFN I noticed there were only small parts that I had to puzzle togehter to make BlackFN working I didn't liked this so I open-sourced and made configuration easy for everyone but I'm getting out of context BlackFNRedirect is basically the 10.00 Redirect for OGFN but this one is different this one opens a Proxy on Port "8432" this means every device that supports Fortnite and an External Proxy will be able to Redirect Epic's Backend to for example the BlackFN Backend or any other OGFN Backend**
